# OOP-Java
Learning OOP through a book before my sophomore year in high school. I will be using a book titled "Core-Java, Volume 1" (12th edition) by Cay Hortsman. As I became proficient with the basics in my freshman introductory CS class, my goal in using this book is to extend my learning to OOP, a fundamental topic for any programmer. Let the learning begin!

Note: Day-something files are files that track my progress for each day I did work. A ton of days may be missing as I sometimes take time to write and understand the files and concepts in the book. Furthermore, files with the prefix "Ex" are files that I created on my own. These are exercise questions that I searched online in order to practice my new OOP skills.
